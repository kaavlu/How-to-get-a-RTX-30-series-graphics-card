# Tips for getting a card
1. Cards usually drop near 9-9:20 AM PST so make sure that you are on your computer near that time every weekday
2. I Have noticed cards usually drop every 1.5-2 weeks so if there hasn't been a drop for a week or 2 there will be one very soon
3. When octoshop pings you that there is a drop of a card, open up every other fe card in a diffrent link and refresh on the card you want. For example, if a 3090 comes in stock and octoshop pings you, click the add to cart button for the 3090 and then open up all the other cards before it even pings you. This way you will be one of the first people in line to buy the other 4/5 cards
4. If you miss a drop it is completley ok. Bestbuy usually drops 2 or 3 times on the day they drop within 20-30 minute intervals so keep on checking
